<p>The Data Registration tool allows you to align data or images obtained from
different instruments. For instance, here are two images of a some metal
patterns produced by lithography, one obtained with an AFM, and one obtained
with an SEM:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/registration_reference.gif" width="308" height="327">&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="../images/registration_adjustable.gif" width="308" height="327"></p>
<p>They show the same features, but they are not exactly aligned - indeed this
would be very difficult to accomplish manually. The Data Registration tool uses <b>correspondence
points</b> to align the data in these two images.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the basic procedure:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click to place a correspondence point. A marker icon appears in both image
    windows.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Drag either marker icon, so that both icons lie over the same
    feature.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Repeat until at least 3, but preferably 10 or more, points are
    placed.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Click the <b>Display in surface view</b> button to see the adjustable image
displayed as a texture over the current height plane.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the image is registered, type a name into the <b>Resample plane name</b>
box to create a new plane of data that is aligned with the height plane, and can
be used for color maps or contour lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/data_registration_controls.gif" width="385" height="623"></p>
<p>The registration module is designed to take two images and return a
transformation from one image to the other. I've labeled the two images as
topography and projection image. The topography image may be thought of as
a reference or source image for the transformation and the projection
image is the test or target image. The transformation takes points in the
reference image into points in the projection image. When you do something
that tells the registration module to compute a transformation, that
transformation gets sent to the graphics code and is used to set the
transformation matrix for projective textures so that if you are
displaying the reference image as the surface and you select the "Display
Texture" checkbox in the registration window, it will overlay the
projection image as a texture on top of the reference surface.
<p>
When you open up the registration control panel there should be two image
windows that pop up in synchrony with the control panel (they go away when
you close the control panel too). These windows let you specify a
correspondence between points in the selected topography and projection
images. To add a correspondence point, you click in either of the image
windows with the right mouse button. Note that a corresponding point will
automatically be placed in the other image at the same relative position
in the image (if you place a point in the middle of one image the
corresponding point will show up in the middle of the other image). A
yellow square around a point indicates that it is selected and can be
dragged or deleted. You can select a point by clicking near it with the
left mouse button and you can drag it by holding down the left mouse
button after clicking on it and moving the mouse.
<p>
It used to be that you had to press the "Register" button to tell the
program to compute a new transformation from the current correspondence
but now it does this automatically whenever you move one of the points so
that the process can be more interactive.&nbsp;
<p>
For the future:<p>
I'm working now on making the registration code use mutual information to
compute the best transformation starting with the transformation set by
the user. The interface for this will probably be a button that you press
to let the program automatically adjust the current transformation to
maximize mutual information.
<p>
I still need to add some code that runs the optimization on subsampled
images before applying it to the original image so that the solution is
stable (coarse to fine approach).

<p>I think that would be great to rework the UI. Some of controls I have in
there are so non-intuitive that I don't even remember exactly what some of
them do even though I wrote them (I'm especially uncertain about how they&nbsp;
work in combination). Most of them have to do with creating
the resampled image. Here is what they do I think:
<p>
checkbox for "Topography Region Only": This makes it so that the resampled
image is only for the parts of the image that fall inside the topography
image (the resulting image would be the same region in the world as the
topography image)
If this isn't checked, the code tries to compute how large an image is
required to contain the warped image (I'm not sure how the specified
resolution gets used here but I believe this refers only to the resolution
of the topography region so the full resolution of the image could be
really big if you had scaled up the projection image really big compared
with the topography image) - there ought to be some error generated if the
user has set a transformation that makes this image too big but there
isn't.
<p>
checkbox for "Resample Warped Topography (instead of Projection)": This
computes the inverse of the transformation and applies the inverse
transformation to the topography image to create an image with the same
world region as the projection image (and resample image axes are aligned
with the projection image axes).&nbsp;
If this isn't checked then the resulting
image is in the space of the topography image (image axes are aligned with
the topography image axes).
<p>
slider for "Resample Mixing Ratio": This is the one I'm really not sure
about. When you create a resample image, it can actually be a
combination of the intensities from the two original images. This
control affects how much of each image gets put in the result. Its sort of
or maybe exactly like what you can do with alpha-blending although I could
imagine doing something more general. It seems to work for what Phillip
and Neal need for their lithography planning images. You should try
picking a value in the middle to see whats going on when you play with the
other controls.
<p>
One thing I don't like about the resampling is that it is really slow. Its
nice to have this in software so we know exactly what kind of filtering is
going on. Also, its a simple way to get around any limitations on usage of
texture memory that we might run into if this were done in hardware - I'm
running into this problem when I try to display large textures in the
seegerizer. I think this code could be optimized a lot.
<p>
Note that you can set the resolution of the resample image to something
arbitrary at the bottom of the control panel.
<p>
As far as I know you can't do anything with the resampled image except
save it or display it as a texture (if you select this as the projection
image and set the transformation to the identity it should show up as
aligned on the surface).
<p>
Something that ought to be added to the UI is some display of the
transformation (in an intuitive form like how much rotation, shearing and
scaling there is)
