<p>Making further advances in such diverse problems as building more powerful
computers, measuring material properties of biological samples or exploring
fundamental physical laws on the atomic level requires gaining access the to the
nanoworld. The NanoManipulator system adds a virtual-reality interface to an
atomic-force microscope (AFM), thus providing a tool that can be used by
scientists to image <i>and</i> manipulate nanometer-sized molecular structures
in a controlled manner. As the AFM tip scans the sample, the tip-sample
interaction forces are monitored which, in turn, can yield information about the
frictional, mechanical, material and topological properties of the sample.
Computer graphics are used to reconstruct the surface for the user, with color
or contours overlaid to indicate additional data sets. Moreover, a force
feed-back stylus, which is connected to the tip via software, allows the user to
directly interact with the macromolecules.</p>

<p>II. THE NANOMANIPULATOR</p>
<i>
<p>A. AFM: Contact mode and tapping mode</p>
</i>
<p>The NanoManipulator system (Fig. 1) basically consists of three parts that
are interconnected by software: an atomic force microscope (plus controller), a
graphics engine/interface and a Phantom force stylus (plus controller).</p>
<p>In an AFM, also known as a scanning force microscope (SFM), the sample is
scanned by a very sharp tip, which is mounted on a flexible cantilever [24]. As
the tip scans over the sample, the cantilever is deflected by the topographical
features of the sample. These deflections are usually recorded by an optical
lever system, converted back into topography by a computer and displayed on a
screen. Atomic resolution has been obtained with this instrument [25], and
samples can also be imaged in liquid [26-29]. The AFM may be operated in two
distinct modes: <i>contact </i>mode or <i>tapping (intermittent contac</i>t)
mode. </p>
<p>When a sample is scanned in contact mode, the tip is continuously touching
the sample, and, therefore, significant normal and lateral forces may be exerted
on the sample. In contrast, when using tapping mode, the cantilever is
oscillated perpendicular to the surface as it scans over the surface. Hence, the
tip touches the sample only intermittently, and lateral forces are nearly
eliminated.</p>
<p>The NanoManipulator exploits this crucial difference between the two modes:
Samples can be manipulated in contact mode with a controlled the normal force
and they can be imaged before and after a manipulation in tapping mode without
further modifying them. Depending on the cantilever, forces ranging from a few
attoNewtons [30] to several tens of microNewtons can be measured - a range that
is not accessible by any other single technique. Forces can be measured in the
normal (z) and the lateral (x-y) direction.</p>
<p><i>B. Graphics Interface and Phantom force stylus</p>
<p>1) Interface and manipulations</p>
</i>
<p>The NanoManipulator is used in either the imaging mode or the manipulation
mode.</p>
<p>Regardless of which mode is used, the microscope controller responsible for
the microscope feedback and data collection runs at a rate of about 100,000Hz.
This feedback loop keeps the normal force or amplitude of the cantilever
constant. The collected data are send to a graphics engine which updates the
three-dimensional virtual reality display at a rate of about 20 Hz. Furthermore,
the collected data are send to the Phantom controller which reconstructs the 'feelable'
surface for the user at a rate of about 1000 Hz.</p>
<p>In the imaging mode, the force stylus, which is connected to the Phantom
controller, can be used to either feel the surface, to move the surface with 6
degrees of freedom or to zoom in and out. It is important to notice that in the
imaging mode, the user does not control the microscope tip but he/she merely
sees or feels the reconstructed surface.</p>
<p>Conversely, in the manipulation mode the user has control over the movement
of the tip. The tip is now virtually connected to the Phantom stylus and the
stylus can be used to move the tip over the surface in order to manipulate
objects on it. These manipulations can be carried out in several different ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
1.) <i>Lateral force </i>(x-y direction). By positioning the tip carefully next
to the sample, lateral forces can be applied in contact mode to modify a chosen
object in a controlled manner while the normal force is kept constant. This mode
can also be used for ‘AFM lithography’, where the tip is used to write or
scratch patterns on the surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p> 2.) <i>Normal force </i>(z direction). The user
can also apply normal forces to the sample under investigation while the lateral
position is kept constant. In this case, the tip is placed on top of the sample
by using the haptic feedback, and is then pushed into and retracted from the
sample (computer controlled force curve).&nbsp;</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The NanoManipulator makes all these manipulations straightforward, with a
natural and transparent interface for the user.</p>
<p>The scaling factor between the Phantom force stylus and the image is such
that the range of the stylus (about 30 cm) corresponds to the range of the image
on the screen. Thus, the scaling factor depends on the image size; operating on
a 300x300 nm<sup>2</sup> or a 30x30 µm<sup>2</sup> image translates into a scaling factor of 10<sup>6</sup>
or 10<sup>4</sup> , respectively. </p>
<i>
<p>2) Haptics and force feed-back</p>
</i>
<p>As mentioned above the data coming from the microscope are sent to the
Phantom controller, which re-constructs a ‘feelable’ surface for the user.
Thus, all the data collected by the microscope (topography, frictional force
images, error signal images, compliance, and others) can be felt by the user. In
its current version, the data are presented to the user as a hard surface that
can be traced with the force stylus. In its simplest version, the user just
feels the ‘bumps’ and ‘valleys’ of the topography of the sample.
However, it is also possible to sense, for instance, regions of high and low
friction where high friction may be represented as raised regions and low
friction as lower regions.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned, however, that the user does not directly feel forces
which are proportional to the actual forces acting on the cantilever, but he/she
just feels a surface representation that is simultaneously reconstructed by the
Phantom controller from the microscope data.</p>
<p>The force feedback component of the NanoManipulator system has always been
exciting to the scientists on the team, as they can feel the surface under
investigation.</p>
<p>However, it is during modifications that force feedback has been found to be
most useful, allowing finer control and enabling whole new types of experiments.
Force feedback has proved essential to finding the right spot to start a
modification, finding the path along which to modify, and providing a subtler
touch than would be permitted by the standard scan-modify-scan experiment cycle.</p>
<p>Due to drift and hysteresis in the piezoceramic positioners of AFMs, the
actual tip position may depend on environmental conditions and the history of
the experiment.</p>
<p>Therefore, the location of the tip relative to the sample might change over
time. This makes it difficult to plan modifications accurately based only on an
image that is reconstructed from scanned data. Force feedback, on the other
hand, allows the user to locate objects and features on the surface by touch.</p>
<i>
<p>3) Virtual reality display</p>
</i>
<p>Ordinarily (without virtual reality), all of the data are already available
to the scientist in a simple pseudo-color two-dimensional display (top view). In
this simple data presentation, the scientist can measure any feature of the data
to exacting precision using standard techniques such as cross sections and
statistical algorithms. </p>
<p>The NanoManipulator (Fig. 1) adds an advanced virtual reality/graphics
interface to the AFM. As experiments are done, the topographic data are rendered
in real time as a three-dimensional, directionally illuminated image, which
makes the interpretation of height data more intuitive than in a simple
two-dimensional display.</p>
<p>The added, advanced VR display was found to be beneficial even for viewing
static data sets. This is hardly surprising, since such data sets are often
rendered for publication as shaded 3D images and give the audience a better
understanding of the surface shape. A further benefit of advanced visualization
comes from getting multiple naturally controlled views of the data that may
reveal unexpected insights. Some of the users had examined one data set using
pseudo-color images for months, yet discovered an important feature of the data
(graphite sheets extruding from the surface) within seconds of viewing a
real-time fly-over of the data set. These sheets were visible in only a few
frames of the fly-over, when the lighting and eye point were in just the right
position to highlight them [22]</p>
<p>Generally, small features on surfaces with other height variations are better
brought out using specular highlighting of a 3D surface (and are sometimes
imperceptible in a 2D display). On the other hand, small features on very flat
surfaces are better seen using standard, 2D-pseudo-color topviews (and are
sometimes imperceptible in a 3D display). The NanoManipulator provides both the
2D and 3D views simultaneously, each updated as the experiment progresses.</p>
