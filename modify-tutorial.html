<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#339966">NanoManipulator DP 100<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>In order to successfully use the NanoManipulator, you must be familiar with the
ThermoMicroscopes SPM you
will be using, and be able to image the sample. You should also
have some idea what settings would be used with the SPM tip you
are using for imaging in contact and non-contact/oscillating mode.
</p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#339966">Connecting to your SPM
<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>First, load a sample and tip in your SPM. On the
ThermoMicroscopes SPM controller computer, start SPMLab using the <b>NM DP100 SPML 5.01
</b>icon (We'll refer to this as the TM software). This version knows how to
connect to the NanoManipulator. Put the tip into feedback and start scanning
your sample, as described in ThermoMicroscopes manual and training procedures.
Now you are ready to connect to the NanoManipulator.
</p>

<p>Now, on the NanoManipulator computer, start the NanoManipulator, either by
double-clicking the desktop icon, or choosing <b>Start .. Programs ..
NanoManipulator .. NanoManipulator</b>.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>If this is the first time you have run the NanoManipulator since rebooting
your computer, the Phantom may not be centered on the surface when it is
centered in its workspace. If you move the Phantom pen and can't reach the
corners of the surface, move the Phantom through it's working volume, and then
choose <b>Tools .. <a href="tools_menu/phantom.htm">Phantom</a></b> and press
the <b>Reset Phantom</b> button.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>To open a connection to an SPM, choose <b><a href="file_menu/open_spm_connection.htm">Open SPM Connection</a> </b>from the <b>File</b>
menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Open SPM Connection dialog appears. Click the <b>Choose...</b> button and
change the word &quot;log&quot; in the suggested filename to
&quot;tutorial&quot;, and click <b>OK</b>. Click <b>Open</b>, and the
NanoManipulator will connect to your ThermoMicroscopes SPM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will see the <b>Image Params</b> and <b>Modify Params</b> windows appear
along the left edge, and the <strong>setpoint, P, I,</strong>
and <strong>D gain</strong>  parameters will change to match those set in the TM
software. You will probably have to hit the <a href="phantom_modes.htm#Center"><b>Center</b></a>
button to get a view of the surface.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#339966">SPM Control
<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p><b>Imaging controls:</b> There are two ways you can change the feedback parameters for imaging your sample.
In the <strong>Tipcontrol</strong> menu, choose <strong><a href="tip_control_menu/image_controls.htm">Image
Params</a></strong>. This window provides entry
boxes to immediately change the <strong>setpoint, P, I,</strong>
and <strong>D gain</strong> parameters. These are directly linked
to the TM software, so adjust them the same way you would in
the TM software.</p>

<p>If you click the <b>Full params </b>button, the window expands to show more
options. The difference is
that this view lets you switch between <strong>oscillating</strong>
and <strong>contact</strong> mode imaging. To use oscillating
mode, the drive frequency and other parameters should be set up
in the TM software. You can also change the <strong>setpoint</strong>
and <strong>PID</strong> in this panel - but they do not take affect until you
click <b>Accept</b>. This allows you to switch from oscillating to contact (or
vice versa) and set an appropriate setpoint all in one step. If you change your
mind, click <b>Revert</b> and all parameters will be changed back to the current
SPM settings.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>Modify controls:</b>  To set up parameters for a modification, choose <strong>Tipcontrol
.. <a href="tip_control_menu/modify_controls.html">Modify Params</a></strong>. The NanoManipulator
can automatically switch from
oscillating mode imaging to contact mode modifications. This is
most often what is done, because contact mode can provide a
higher force for modification than oscillating mode, and provide
lateral force measurements.</p>

<p>To set up for a modification, first choose the
feedback parameters to use. To avoid damaging your sample or tip
unnecessarily, start by choosing the setpoint and the PID that
you might use to image the sample. Then, if the sample is not
modified, increase the setpoint for the next modification until
the sample is modified.</p>

<p>Remember to set the setpoint based on the <b>free</b>
value of the T-B (top minus bottom) signal for contact mode
modifications. You can determine this value by withdrawing the tip, turning off
oscillating/non-contact mode, and observing the T-B signal in the oscilloscope
window of the TM software.</p>

<p>The <b><a href="tip_control_menu/modify_controls.html#Style">style</a></b> of modification affects how the
SPM tip moves as the modification progresses. The <b>sharp</b>
style is the simplest, in which the tip simply follows your
movements while keeping in contact with the surface. Use sharp
style for this tutorial, but check the <a href="tip_control_menu/modify_controls.html#Style">modification
parameters, style</a> page for explanations of
all available styles.</p>

<p>The <b><a href="tip_control_menu/modify_controls.html#Tools">tool</a></b> determines where the tip moves.
Two tools are often used. With the <b>freehand</b> tool, the tip
follows your hand position as you move, and you can feel the
sample as it changes during your modification. With the <b>line</b>
tool, you feel where you want the endpoints of a modification to
be, then let the computer automatically make the modification. Check the <a href="tip_control_menu/modify_controls.html#Tools">modification
parameters, tools</a> page
for explanations of all available tools.</p>

<p>Here are the steps of a modification: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Determine where you want to make a
        modification. In <b>grab</b> mode, see if the hand icon
        can penetrate the surface at that position. If not, you
        should grab the surface and move it so that spot is
        easily reachable. (<a href="phantom_modes.htm#Grab">About <strong>grab</strong> 
      mode</a>)</li>
    <li>Make
        sure you are using reasonable modification parameters.
        For a start, choose a contact mode modification; set the PID to be the same you are using for imaging, and make the <b>setpoint</b> about 4 nanoAmps higher
        than the free space value of the T-B signal.</li>
    <li>Choose the <b>sharp</b> style, and choose
        your tool (See 5 for <b>freehand</b> and 6 for <b>line</b> tools).</li>
    <li>Press the <b>touch </b>button. The Phantom
        is now in the mode that allows you to make a modification
        to your sample.</li>
    <li>If you choose the <b>freehand</b> tool,
        the tip follows your hand to make the modification. When
        your press the Phantom button, the SPM tip follows your
        hand and you can feel the height of the surface as
        measured by the microscope. There are two actions you can
        take:<ol>
            <li>If you release the Phantom button, the SPM will resume scanning the surface.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>If you hit
                the <b>commit</b>  button (Magellan button 4), the SPM will start
                using the modification parameters you set up,
                which usually means it will press harder on the surface. You can still feel the
                shape of surface while the modification is
                happening. When you are done, release the button,
                and the SPM will resume scanning the surface.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If you choose the <b>line</b> tool, you
        specify where the modification is going to happen, and
        then the NanoManipulator executes the modification automatically. When you press the Phantom
        button, the SPM tip follows your hand. When you release
        the button, the end of the line is marked with a vertical
        blue line. Then you can press the Phantom button again to
        feel the surface, and release to mark the other end of
        the line. If you continue pressing and releasing, you can
        specify a whole series of lines for the modification to
        follow.&nbsp;
      <ol>
        <li> If you misplace a marker, hit the <b>cancel</b>
        button to start over placing markers.&nbsp;The SPM will resume
          scanning.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>If you are satisfied,
        hit the <b>commit</b> button, and the microscope does the
        modification.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The <b><a href="tools_menu/stripchart.htm">Stripchart</a></b> window pops up as soon as
you start your first modification. By default, it graphs the height the tip is
measuring and the lateral force. It can graph all the data that is
being received from the SPM, including the tip's position on the
surface, lateral force, and internal sensor. To export the modification data, go
to <b>File .. <a href="file_menu/save_mod_data.htm"> Save modification data</a></b>. The text file produced can be easily opened in
KaliedaGraph, Excel, or another graphing package to analyze the
modification which was performed. But don't worry if you don't
save a modification file - all the data you are taking is saved in the <b>stream</b>
 file. </p>

<p>When you are done scanning and modifying your
sample, go to <b>File .. <a href="file_menu/close.htm">Close</a></b> to disconnect from the SPM, or to <b>File ..
Exit</b> to disconnect and exit. Your stream file will be saved to disk.&nbsp; </p>

<h2><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#339999">Viewing stream files<!--mstheme--></font></h2>

<p>The NanoManipulator recognizes files that end in the &quot;.nms&quot;
extension as NanoManipulator Stream files, and will open them if you
double-click on them using the Windows Explorer. You can also start the
NanoManipulator, and use the <b>File .. <a href="file_menu/open_stream_files.htm">Open
Stream File</a></b> menu item to open a stream file.&nbsp;Review the <a href="visualization_and_replay.htm">Visualization and Replay</a>
tutorial for more hints on viewing and analyzing your recorded
experiments.&nbsp; </p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#339966">Getting data for analysis:<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>
There are two types of data you might want to do
more analysis on: the scan data and the modification data. The <a href="tools_menu/stripchart.htm">Stripchart</a> lets you see roughly what happened during a
modification, but other analysis packages can do more, like fit
curves and make many changes to the appearance of the graph. We
already described how to save the modification data above - just go to <b>File
.. <a href="file_menu/save_mod_data.htm"> Save modification data</a></b>. The save dialog suggests a filename based on the time the
modification started.
</p>

<p>To save scan data, choose <b>File .. <a href="file_menu/save_plane_data.htm">Save Plane Data</a></b>.
You can save scan data as a ThermoMicroscopes file and open it in the SPMLab
software to do analysis on it.&nbsp;
</p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#339966">Presentation:<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>The 3D view of the surface can be extremely
effective for presentation of your data. To save a picture of
the screen, go to <b>File .. <a href="file_menu/save_screenshot.htm"> Save screen</a></b>. The
<b>Show screen text </b>toggle button removes text and other decorations from the screen, so you
can add your own labels later with another program. An often-used
technique is to freeze the replay before a modification, save a
TIFF file, then pause again after the modification and one scan
of the surface has been completed, and save another TIFF file, to
show the results of a modification. TIFF files can be imported
into MS Word and PowerPoint, and are not compressed, so they
preserve all color data. </p>
