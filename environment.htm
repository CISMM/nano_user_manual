<p>Several features of the NanoManipulator are controlled by the setup program
provided. It will already have been run on the NanoManipulator system computer
when it is delivered. </p>
<p>The files necessary to run are placed by default in C:\Program
Files\NanoManipulator.</p>
<p>The default data directory is normally placed at C:\Data, although it may be
placed on a different drive if it has more available space.</p>
<p>Three environment variables are set during program installations:</p>
<p>NANO_ROOT points to the installation directory. Don't change this variable -
un-install and re-install the NanoManipulator if you need to change its
installation directory. </p>
<p>TRACKER specifies whether there is a Phantom attached to the machine or not.
If there is one, TRACKER is set to &quot;null Phantom0&quot;. If there is not a
Phantom attached, TRACKER is set to &quot;null null&quot;. Change the value of
this variable by opening the System Control Panel, and choosing the Environment
tab. Click on the TRACKER system variable, and change its value. Click Set, then
OK or Apply for the change to take effect. </p>
<p>If the Phantom is not attached, and TRACKER is set to &quot;null null&quot;, you can still move the hand icon using <a href="mouse_phantom.htm">Mouse Phantom</a>
emulation. </p>
<p>BDBOX specifies whether there is a Magellan attached. If there is, BDBOX
is set to &quot;Magellan0&quot;. If there is not a Magellan attached, BDBOX is
set to &quot;null&quot;. Change the value of this variable by opening the System
Control Panel, and choosing the Environment tab. Click on the BDBOX system
variable, and change its value. Click Set, then OK or Apply for the change to
take effect. </p>
<p>The NanoManipulator program is associated with the &quot;.nms&quot; file
extension, so that when you double-click on a file ending in &quot;.nms&quot;,
the NanoManipulator will attempt to open it as a NanoManipulator Stream File.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body>
