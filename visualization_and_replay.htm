<p>This tutorial will introduce basic features of the NanoManipulator, and cover
visualization tools and the controls for replaying recorded experiments.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#339999">Getting Started<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
<p><b>Start the NanoManipulator</b>. Double click the <b>NanoManipulator</b>
icon on the desktop, or choose <b>Start .. Program Files .. NanoManipulator ..
NanoManipulator</b>. When the program starts, you should hear the <a href="magellan_controls.htm">Magellan</a>
beep and the indicator light on the <a href="phantom_modes.htm">Phantom</a>
should change from orange or blinking green to solid green.</p>
<p><b>Open a static file</b>. From the <b>File</b> menu,</p>
<p>&nbsp; <img border="0" src="images/file_filemenu.gif" width="609" height="233"></p>
<p> choose <b><a href="file_menu/open_static_files.htm">Open
Static Files...</a></b> When the dialog opens, double-click on the folder named <i>sample-data</i>
then choose the file <i>adeno_spill_dna.tfr</i>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/open_adeno.gif" width="426" height="264"></p>
<p>When the file opens, the <a href="screen_elements.htm">Surface View Window</a>
should show something like this:</p>
<p><a href="images/sv_adeno.gif"><img border="2" src="images/sv_adeno_small.gif" alt="sv_adeno.gif (70412 bytes)" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>[Click to see a full-sized image]</p>
<p>This image shows adenovirus, a virus which causes colds, but can also be used
to deliver helpful DNA into cells during gene-therapy. The adenovirus on the
lower right has ruptured, and its DNA is laying on the surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To become familiar with the Phantom, try each of the modes described
below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, <a href="phantom_modes.htm#The Green Aim Line">the green aim-line</a>
can help you determine the position of your hand in three dimensions, especially
related to the position of the surface. Read about it in <a href="phantom_modes.htm#The Green Aim Line">this</a>
short paragraph, then use the
&quot;back&quot; button to return to this tutorial.</p>
<p>Change the function of the Phantom in two different ways. First, examine the
main window below and observe all the buttons at the top. You can click on any
of these buttons to change the function of the Phantom. Second, you can use the
Magellan. This is the preferred method, because it is easier to use the Magellan
in your non-dominant hand than it is to use the mouse and click on a button. The
Magellan button which can activate each function labels a box surrounding the
function. So button 1 activates Grab, button 5 activates Center, button 2
activates Position Light (and if you press it again it will activate Measure,
then Scale Up, then Scale Down), button 6 activates Touch Stored.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/main_win_disabled.gif" width="609" height="198"></p>
<p>Buttons 3, 4, 7, and 8 are disabled, because these functions only work when
connected to a live SPM, and not when looking at a static file or replaying an
experiment. Their use is covered in the <a href="modify-tutorial.html">Manipulation Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>Click on the links to find out more information, then use the
&quot;back&quot; button to return to this page.</p>
<p><a href="phantom_modes.htm#Grab">Grab</a> (Magellan button 1) - Press the
Phantom button and move the surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="phantom_modes.htm#Center">Center</a> (Magellan button 5) - After you
move the surface or the light, press Center to return to the default view.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="phantom_modes.htm#Position Light">Position light</a> (Magellan
button 2) - Push the Phantom button, twist and rotate the pen to move the light.</p>
<p><a href="analysis_menu/measure_lines.htm">Measure</a> (Magellan button 2) -
Dragging the red, yellow and blue lines lets you measure the size of surface
features.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="phantom_modes.htm#Scale Up and Down">Scale Up</a> (Magellan button
2) - Enlarge your view.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="phantom_modes.htm#Scale Up and Down">Scale Down</a> (Magellan button
2) - Shrink your view.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="phantom_modes.htm#Touch Stored">Touch Stored</a> (Magellan button 6) - Push the Phantom
button to feel the shape of the surface that you see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few suggested tasks, which will help you become more comfortable with the
Phantom.</p>
<p>Change the position of the light to best pick out the DNA on the
substrate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the measure lines to find the width and height of an adenovirus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Position all three measure lines near one strand of DNA, then use scale-up to zoom in on the
DNA. Now the measure lines are in easy reach to measure the height and width of
a DNA strand.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#339966">Save a Screen Image<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>Show others what you've done. Follow the <a href="file_menu/save_screenshot.htm">Save Screen</a>
instructions to save a TIFF image. This format can be read by any Microsoft
Office product, as well as most image viewers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, in Microsoft Word, go to the <b>Insert</b> menu, and choose <b>Picture
.. From File</b>. You should be able to see a preview of the TIFF file before
you import it.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#339966">Color Maps<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>Add impact to the surface view. We can use the color map to emphasize the
features in the height plane, by showing the data from our static file with a
color map as well. Follow the <a href="setup_menu/color_map.htm">Color Map</a>
instructions, and choose the <i>adeno_spill_dna.tfr</i> as the color map plane,
and choose the second color bar, blk-blue-cyan-wht, as the color map. You should see
something like this (press Center if you need to):</p>
<p><a href="images/sv_blue_colormap.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/sv_blue_colormap_small.jpg" alt="sv_blue_colormap.jpg (57896 bytes)" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>[Click to see a full-sized image]</p>
<p>Interesting, but there is a slope to the substrate which we didn't notice
before, which is emphasized by the color map. To eliminate this, we turn to <a href="analysis_menu/calculate_data_planes.htm">Calculate Data Planes</a>
and create a Flattened plane. Click the Calculate Data Planes button to open the
dialog, and type <i>flat</i> into the first entry widget, and press Enter. Close the window and
choose <i>flat </i>as the Color map plane. Your view should change to this:</p>
<p><a href="images/sv_flat_colormap.jpg"><img border="2" src="images/sv_flat_colormap_small.jpg" alt="sv_flat_colormap.jpg (58848 bytes)" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>[Click to see a full-sized image]</p>
<p>Much better - the substrate is now nearly uniform in color, indicating that
it is mapped to a single height. Now drag the arrows in the Colormap window to see
how they affect the color map. In particular, if you drag the Color Max arrow
down very close to the Color Min arrow, you should be able to highlight the DNA
on the surface, like this:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DNA_color.jpg" width="335" height="341"></p>
<p>To recover the default settings for the color map, click the <b>Autoscale</b>
button.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#339966">Automatic Lab Notebook<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>Next we'll start looking at a complete recorded experiment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open an automatic lab notebook</b>. Automatic lab notebooks are also
called <b>stream files</b>. From the <b>File</b> menu, choose <b><a href="file_menu/open_stream_files.htm">Open Stream
File...</a></b> When the dialog opens, you should already be inside the folder <i>sample_data</i>.
Choose the file <i>ohio-fibrin-9-26.nms</i>, as shown, and click Open.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/open_ohio_fibrin.gif" width="426" height="264"></p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#339966">Replay Control<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>As soon as the stream file opens, it starts replaying. And the surface
disappears! This is just a side-effect of the SPM scanning a different region of
the surface than you were looking at before opening the stream file. Hit the <a href="phantom_modes.htm#Center">Center</a>
button to get a view of the surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the <a href="tools_menu/replay_control.htm">Replay Control</a>
instructions to find out how to control the replay of this stream file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initial scan of the surface is usually uninteresting to watch. I happen
to know the first scan of the surface takes 270 seconds, so type 300 into the <b>Go
to time:</b> box and hit Enter to jump past the first scan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, we aren't limited to watching the experiment in real-time. Type 15 into
the <b>Speed (1,30):</b> box to replay the stream file at 15 times faster than
the original experiment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you watch the progress of the experiment, press the <b>Pause</b> button at
any time to freeze the action. Press <b>Play</b> to start again. Press <b>Rewind</b>
to start over at the beginning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the first modification takes place around time 1160, the <a href="tools_menu/stripchart.htm">Stripchart</a>
window will pop up. Read about it to find out what it is graphing and how to
change what it is graphing.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#339966">Z-scale<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>The fibrin fibers we are examining are fairly flat and a little bit hard to
see. We can exaggerate their height to get a different picture of their shape.
From the <b>Setup</b> menu, choose <b>Height Plane...</b>, and type 4 into the <b>Z
scale</b> box. The heights measured by the SPM are now exaggerated by a factor
of 4, making some surface features much easier to see.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Century Gothic, Arial, Helvetica" color="#339966">Rulergrid<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>Another tool which can make estimation, analysis, or presentation much easier
is the <a href="analysis_menu/rulergrid.htm">Rulergrid</a>. It simply overlays a
grid on the surface. Choose <b>Analysis .. </b> <a href="analysis_menu/rulergrid.htm"><b>Rulergrid</b></a>
and click <b>Rulergrid
Enabled</b> to turn it on. A yellow grid will be overlaid on the surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate how to use the grid for estimation, we're going to look at a
specific time in this stream file. In the <b><a href="tools_menu/replay_control.htm">Replay
Control</a></b> window, <b>Go to time</b> 900, and <b>Pause</b> the stream file
replay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let's adjust the rulergrid. Enter a <b>Grid spacing</b> of 200, and a <b>Grid
angle</b> of 20. This means the yellow lines are spaced 200 nanometers apart,
and they are displayed at a 20 degree angle from the edge of the scan. I used
the <b>Scale-up</b> control to get this picture:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/sv_rulergrid.jpg" width="514" height="374"></p>
<p>Examining the image, it appears that both fibers are nearly 200 nm wide.
There is something else to consider, however, since we think fibrin fibers are
cylinders, and an AFM tip will widen any feature it scans. This probably means
the fibers are only 50-100 nm wide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want some more practice using the rulergrid or measure lines, find out
how high one of the fibrin fibers is by placing one measure line on top, and
another measure line beside a fiber. Then play the stream file to time 1900 and
estimate the length of each of the modifications made using the rulergrid.&nbsp;</p>
